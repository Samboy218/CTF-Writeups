its super weird. its just javascript, so I plugged the entire thing into my browser web console and it executed without error, but it didnt do anything. So i googled around for like an hour to see if anyone had a decoder for it, but they didnt. I looked at the end and noticed () was at the end, so it was a function call of some sort. then i saw that the parentheses just before that wrapped almost all of the code, so I tried plugging in only that code into my browser web console (see file 'main'), and it spit out:

"if (false) window.flag = 'SKY-JSFK-7391'"

I dont know why that worked, but good enough for me

SKY-JSFK-7391

it gives you the code...but its still not completely readable


joe had a good method, he replaced the () at the end with '.to_string()' and it just gave it to him
