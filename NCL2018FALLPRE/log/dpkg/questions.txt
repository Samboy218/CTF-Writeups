NOTE: I didn't write down the answers to this as I did it, so I had to redo it later without the scoring system, some of these may be wrong

How many times were packages successfully installed (marked "status installed") on the machine?	10	
        cat all.out | grep "status installed" | wc -l
    2130
How many times was the mysql-server-core-5.5 package upgraded?	10	
        there is a package with "upgrader" in its name, so be sure to filter that our
        cat all.out | grep upgrade | grep -v upgrader | grep mysql-server-core-5.5 | wc -l
    6
What non Linux-related package was removed the most?	15	
        cat all.out | grep remove | grep -v linux | grep -v startup | sed -nr 's/.*(remove.*)/\1/p' | sort | uniq -c | sort -n
        that command makes it seem like there are multiple, but I think you don't count different versions as different, which makes mongodb-org the answer
    mongodb-org
What date had the most upgrades on a single day?	25	
        cat all.out | grep upgrade | grep -v upgrader | sed -nr 's/(^[0-9]{4}-[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{2}).*/\1/p' | sort | uniq -c | sort -n
    2016-05-16
