What is the total number of failed attempts (ssh attempt failures)? 50
        this one is tricky because some of the attempts are compressed into "message repeated X times"
        so we need to actually count those out
        cat SSH.log | grep sshd.\*Failed | grep -v "repeated" > exact.out
        cat SSH.log | grep sshd.\*Failed | grep  "repeated" > repeated.out
        cat repeated.out | sed -nr 's/.*repeated (.*) times.*/\1/p' | awk '{ sum += $1 } END { print sum }' >> count
        cat exact.out | wc -l >> count
        cat count | awk '{ sum += $1 } END { print sum }'
    13965
